```

### Phase 2: Google Vision API Setup

#### **API Key Configuration**
1. **Google Cloud Console Setup**
    - Create new project or use existing
    - Enable Vision API and ML Kit
    - Generate API key with proper restrictions

2. **API Key Security**
    - Store in `local.properties` (not in version control)
    - Use BuildConfig for secure access
    - Implement API key rotation strategy

3. **Why Google Vision API?**
    - ML Kit is limited to common objects and basic trash types. For comprehensive trash recognition, Google Vision API offers a much larger dataset and better accuracy for rare or region-specific trash items.
    - As a solo developer, leveraging Google Vision API allows you to tap into Google's resources without building your own massive dataset.
    - **Note:** API usage may incur costs. Consider batching requests and providing offline fallback for common trash types.

4. **API Integration Steps**
    - Add API key to `local.properties` (never commit to git)
    - Use Retrofit or OkHttp for network requests to Vision API
    - Parse results and map to local trash categories
    - Show user-friendly disposal instructions based on API response
    - Log unknown items for future improvement

5. **Testing Google Vision API**
    - Create a test suite with sample trash images
    - Validate API accuracy and response times
    - Document edge cases and fallback logic

### **Implementation in Android:**
```kotlin
// For Lottie animations (easiest)
implementation("com.airbnb.android:lottie-compose:6.2.0")

@Composable
fun PetView(petState: PetState) {
    val animationFile = when(petState) {
        PetState.HAPPY -> "pet_happy.json"
        PetState.SAD -> "pet_sad.json"
        // etc.
    }
    
    LottieAnimation(
        composition = rememberLottieComposition(
            LottieCompositionSpec.Asset(animationFile)
        ).value,
        isPlaying = true,
        iterations = LottieConstants.IterateForever
    )
}
```

### **My Recommendation for You:**
1. **Start with Fiverr commission** for pet design ($50-100)
2. **Use Lottie animations** for easy implementation
